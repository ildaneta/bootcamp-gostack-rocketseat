## :pushpin: Motivation

In this challenge, the proposal for a solution was to make the automated tests pass and, for that, it was necessary to create a front-end application, where the user could insert their favorite repositories.

In addition, it can also delete repositories that it no longer wants to view.

The methods used in this application were:

/ GET
/ POST
/ PUT
/ DELETE
