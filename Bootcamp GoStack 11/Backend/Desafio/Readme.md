# Backend Chalenge - NodeJS Concepts

## :pushpin: Motivation

In this challenge, the proposal for a solution was to make the automated tests pass, and for that, it was necessary to create a REST API on repositories, where the CRUD of the repositories was performed and an additional route was created that will serve to add likes on a repository.

## :woman_technologist: Technologies

- JEST
- Uuidv4
- Express
- Nodemon

## :heavy_check_mark: Installation

1. First, you need to have NodeJS and Yarn installed, then, to clone the project via HTTPS, run the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/ildaneta/bootcamp-gostack-rocketseat.git`

2. If you already have a registered SSH key, you can perform the clone via SSH through the command:

`git clone git@github.com:ildaneta/bootcamp-gostack-rocketseat.git`

3. After cloning, enter the cloned repository:

`cd bootcamp-gostack-rocketseat`

4. After being inside the cloned repository, download the dependencies using:

`yarn` or `yarn add`

5. To run the tests, perform through the command:
